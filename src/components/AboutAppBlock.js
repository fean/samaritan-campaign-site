      The humanitarian refugee effort has been miraculous in the last couple of
      weeks. So many amazing foundations and groups of people have put their
      foot forward and are helping refugees where they can.
      <br /> We aim to bring all these isolated efforts together into one big
      coordinated group. In this way, we want to lower the threshold for people
      to help their fellow humans.
